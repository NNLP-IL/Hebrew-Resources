> We present a comprehensive generation mechanism, 
> which produces vocalized and morphologically tagged Hebrew verbs given a non-vocalized verb 
> in base-form and an indication of which pattern the verb follows. 
> Given a classification of verbs into about 300 distinct clusters, 
> our generation mechanism generates fully vocalized inflected verbal forms. 
> Using our implementation of this method, we have produced a lexical resource for modern Hebrew 
> that includes all inflected forms for over 4,000 distinct verbs. 
> This database contains about 250,000 fully inflected and fully vocalized verbal forms, 
> with an accuracy estimate of over 99.4.
