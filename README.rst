Hebrew NLP Resources
####################

This repository collects resources for NLP in Hebrew, as part of the `NLPH project <https://github.com/NLPH/NLPH>`_, which you can `read more about here <https://github.com/NLPH/NLPH>`_. Resources are divided to folders by type. If you have a resource you can contribute, to be released under some open license, please submit a pull request, or contact us at `contact@nlph.org.il <mailto:contact@nlph.org.il>`_. See `here for a list of companies operating in the field <https://github.com/NLPH/NLPH_Resources/blob/master/Industry.rst>`_.

This specific document is meant to be a list of Hebrew NLP resources, both for general use and to be used as reference when discussing what existing tools can be opened, adapted or integrated to help create a good open source foundation for NLP in Hebrew, as part of the `NLPH Project <https://github.com/NLPH/NLPH>`_.

When contributing to the list, please add a link to the license for all non-paper resources, e.g. {`AGPL-3.0`_}, {?} for an unkonwn licesnse or {X} for unreleased/closed/copyrighted resources. For code resource, please also add the main language in which the tool is written, e.g. [Python] or [?] for an unknown programming language. Please add hosting mirrors with pointy brackets, e.g. `<Zenodo mirror> <https://zenodo.org/record/2707356>`_.
