Word Embeddings
------------------------------

* `fastText pre-trained word vectors <https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText/blob/master/docs/pretrained-vectors.md>`_ for Hebrew {`CC-BY-SA 3.0`_} - Trained on `Wikipedia <https://www.wikipedia.org/>`_ using `fastText <https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText>`_. Comes in both the binary and text default formats of fastText: `binary+text <https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/fasttext/vectors-wiki/wiki.he.zip>`_, `text <https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/fasttext/vectors-wiki/wiki.he.vec>`_. In the text format, each line contains a word followed by its embedding; Each value is space separated; Words are ordered by their frequency in a descending order.
